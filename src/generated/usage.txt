Generate a dissonance curve for the given timbre.

Options:
  -h, --help                         Display this usage and exit.
  -o <file>, --output=<file>         Send output to the specified file.
  -f <format>, --format=<format>     Use the specified output format. The
                                     available formats are csv and tsv.
  -s <number>, --start=<number>      Use the given positive number as the
                                     (inclusive) lower bound of intervals
                                     tested. The default is 1.0.
  -d <number>, --delta=<number>      Use the given positive number as the
                                     difference between each interval tested.
                                     The default is 0.01.
  -e <number>, --end=<number>        Use the given positive number as the
                                     (inclusive) upper bound of intervals
                                     tested. The default is 2.0.
  -x <number>...                     Along with the normal range of numbers,
                                     also compute dissonances for the intervals
                                     specified in this option.
  -p <number>...                     Specify the frequencies of the stationary
                                     partials. If this option is given multiple
                                     times, the partials are concatenated in
                                     the order they were given. Each must be a
                                     positive number.
  -a <number>...                     Specify the amplitudes of the stationary
                                     partials. If this option is given multiple
                                     times, the amplitudes are concatenated in
                                     the order they were given. Each must be a
                                     positive number. The total number of
                                     amplitudes must match the number of
                                     partials, and each nth amplitude will be
                                     matched with the nth partial.
  -P <number>...                     Specify the frequencies of the mobile
                                     partials. If not provided, use the
                                     stationary frequencies by default.
  -A <number>...                     Specify the frequencies of the mobile
                                     amplitudes. If not provided, use the
                                     stationary amplitudes by default. The
                                     number of mobile amplitudes must be equal
                                     to the number of mobile frequencies.
